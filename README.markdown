Rageomatic!
===========
How angry are your tweets?

Rageomatic is a Sinatra app that uses the Twitter API to pull your last 200 tweets. It then picks through them and, using three factors (capital letter usage, exclamation point usage and curse frequency), comes up with an unweighted percentage to represent the wrath of your tweets.

I'm no mathematician, and I'm sure the algorithm can be improved, so if you want to take on the task, go ahead and fork the repo and send a pull request.
